# DAT550 Project
Project as on DAT550 - Data Mining and Deep Learning

**_We used Google Collab in deriving the final file. The initial cells used in linking the Google Drive and visualizing the directory can be ignored._**

The project aims at exploring the various machine learning techniques for detection and analysis of fake news from real news. We are comparing several classifying techniques and implementing neural network approach to explore the model and to detect false news.

**Packages Used:**
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Regex
- NLTK
- SKLearn 
- TensorFlow
- Keras

Every packages has been imported to the notebook file and the system has to have these installed. The packages which are uncommon are listed in the notebook which are installed in the running time.

For example, 

- **!pip install tensorflow_hub**
- **!pip install tensorflow_text**

The notebook file can be easily run to reproduce the results as shown on the report. The pre-run outputs are still demonstrated on the notebook file.

**Note:** To run LSTM Model you need to install glove.6B.100d.txt
We can install glove.6B from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

**Dataset Used:**

Under the data folder (submission):
- Politifact (politifact.json)
- Snopes (snopes.json)
